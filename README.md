Developed a Java-based web chatting application with a client-server architecture for real-time communication.

Technologies and Libraries Used:-

Java Swing for GUI development, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for handling GUI events and painting.
Java Networking (Socket, ServerSocket) for establishing a connection between the client and server.
I/O Streams (DataInputStream, DataOutputStream) for handling data transmission.
Java Utilities (Calendar, SimpleDateFormat) for managing and formatting date and time.
Key Features:-

Real-time messaging with dynamic message display using JPanel and BoxLayout.
User status display, including "Active Now" indication.
Customizable user interface with profile picture, video, phone, and more options.
Smooth and intuitive user experience with action listeners and mouse event handling.
This project showcases my proficiency in Java programming, understanding of network communication, and ability to create interactive GUI applications.
